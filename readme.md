# 🏢 Rental Marketplace Data Analytics Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a modern, scalable, and secure data pipeline on AWS for a fictional "Rental Marketplace" platform. It ingests raw data from Aurora, stages it in S3, and loads it into a layered Redshift Serverless data warehouse, enabling analytics, reporting, and business intelligence.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build an end-to-end ETL pipeline that:
1. **Ingests** raw data from Amazon Aurora.
2. **Stages** it in Amazon S3 using cost-effective columnar storage.
3. **Transforms** and cleans data using AWS Glue.
4. **Loads** data into a layered Redshift Serverless warehouse: **raw**, **curated**, and **presentation**.

## 🧰 Key AWS Services Used

| Service | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Amazon Aurora (MySQL)** | Source transactional database |
| **AWS Glue Crawler** | Extract schemas from Aurora and S3 into the Glue Data Catalog |
| **AWS Glue Data Catalog** | Metadata store for structured tables |
| **Amazon S3** | Raw data staging (Parquet format) |
| **AWS Glue Jobs (Visual)** | All ETL/ELT processes across the pipeline |
| **Amazon Redshift Serverless** | Data warehouse with layered schemas |
| **IAM Roles** | Secure cross-service access |
| **Amazon VPC + Private Subnets** | Secure networking for Glue, Aurora, and Redshift |
| **VPC Endpoints** | Private connectivity to services like S3, STS, Redshift, Secrets Manager |

---

## 🔁 Data Flow Breakdown

### 1. **Data Source – Aurora MySQL**
Houses the operational data for rental properties, users, bookings, and viewing history.

### 2. **Ingest to S3 Raw Data Lake**
- **Glue Crawler** detects table structures in Aurora.
- **Glue Job** extracts data via JDBC, writes it to S3 in Parquet format.
- Data is organized in folders like:  
  `s3://your-bucket/raw/apartment_attributes/`

### 3. **Load to Redshift – Raw Layer**
- **Glue Job** reads from S3 Parquet
- Loads data into the `raw_layer` schema in **Redshift Serverless**

### 4. **Transform to Curated Layer**
- **Glue Visual Job** reads from Redshift `raw_layer`
- Applies transformations (e.g., drop columns, rename, joins)
- Writes results into `curated` schema

### 5. **(Optional) Presentation Layer – Future**
- Aggregated views, KPIs, and business-focused tables will go here for dashboarding and reporting.

---

## 📦 Redshift Schema Layers

| Schema | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `raw_layer` | Exact dump from source, no changes |
| `curated` | Cleaned, joined, business-ready tables |
| `presentation` | (Planned) KPI tables for BI tools |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Set up Aurora MySQL**  
Deploy Aurora in your VPC with sample data.

### 2. **Create an S3 Bucket**  
Used for raw data lake + Glue job temp paths.

### 3. **Configure Networking**
- Use **Private Subnets**
- Create security groups for Aurora, Glue, and Redshift
- Add **VPC Endpoints**:
  - S3
  - Secrets Manager
  - Redshift
  - STS
  - Glue
  - KMS (optional)

### 4. **IAM Roles**
Create IAM roles for:
- Glue Crawler
- Glue Jobs
- Redshift access

Ensure these roles have policies for:
- `s3:*`
- `redshift:*`
- `glue:*`
- `secretsmanager:*`
- `sts:AssumeRole`

### 5. **Redshift Serverless Setup**
- Create workgroup in private subnets
- Attach the correct IAM role to allow Redshift to read from S3

### 6. **Build Glue Components**
- **Glue Crawler** for Aurora
- **Glue Job**: Aurora → S3
- **Glue Job**: S3 → Redshift `raw_layer`
- **Glue Job**: Redshift `raw_layer` → `curated`

---

## 🧪 Example Tables Used

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `apartments` | Apartment listings |
| `apartment_attributes` | Amenities, size, etc. |
| `bookings` | Booking records |
| `user_viewing` | User views and wishlist logs |

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add a **presentation layer** with aggregated metrics
- Connect **Amazon QuickSight** to Redshift for dashboards
- Implement **job orchestration** using **Step Functions** or **Airflow**
- Add **data quality checks** (e.g., row counts, null scans)

---

## 📚 Ideal For

- Academic projects (Data Engineering, Cloud Computing)
- Portfolio projects to showcase AWS skills
- Hands-on ETL/ELT pipeline experience with Glue + Redshift
- Prep for real-world data engineering interviews
